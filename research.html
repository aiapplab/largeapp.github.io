        <strong>Brain Informatics and Health</strong>: Informatics-enabled studies are transforming brain science. New methodologies enhance human interpretive powers when dealing with big data sets increasingly derived from advanced neuro-imaging technologies, including fMRI, PET, and MEG, as well as from other sources like eye-tracking and from wearable, portable and micro devices. We focus on leveraging meachine learning techniques (e.g. deep learning) to assist brain neurological disorder and diseases diagnosis, 
and developing new meachin learning algorithms and tools with brain science research community. </p>  
         <strong>Fraud Detection</strong>: In the big data era, the veracity of the data increasingly becomes a concern. Our research on fraud detection focuses on fraud detection in Internet big data settings, such as click and conversion fraud in online advertising, and fake fans in social media.</p>
        <strong>Recommender System</strong>: Our research on recommender system focuses on recomendation algorithms in Internet big data settings, such as online mobile advertising, and focuses on customer behaviors (e.g. user churn, upgrade) prediction in big data setting, such as marketing in telecommunication sector. </p>
         <strong>AI for IT Operations</strong>: Our research on AI for IT Operation focuses on abnormal analysis and behavior prediction with AI for network traffic, user behavior and device logs, in various networking settings.
