        <strong>Brain Informatics and Health</strong>: Informatics-enabled studies are transforming brain science. New methodologies enhance human interpretive powers when dealing with big data sets increasingly derived from advanced neuro-imaging technologies, including fMRI, PET, and MEG, as well as from other sources like eye-tracking and from wearable, portable, micro and nano devices.Brain Informatics is an emerging interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research field that combines the efforts of Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Machine Learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Information and Communication Technology to explore the main problems that lie in the interplay between human brain studies and informatics research. We focus on leveraging meachine learning techniques (e.g. deep learning) to assist brain diseases diagnosis, 
and developing new meachin learning algorithms and tools with brain science research community.   
         <strong>Fraud Detection</strong>: Our research on fraud detection focuses on fraud detection on online advertising and social media, such as click fraud, fake traffic, fake fans and comments.
         <strong>Recommender System</strong>: Our research on recommender system focuses on online advertising on big data setting, and customer behaviors (e.g. User churn, upgrade) prediction in big data marketing.  
         <strong>AI for IT Operations</strong>: Our research on AI for IT Operation focuses on collection, analysis and abnomal prediction for network traffic, server logs and network device logs.
